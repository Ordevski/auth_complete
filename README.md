# MERN Stack Authentication System

This project implements a robust authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The system ensures secure user verification and password management through OTP (One-Time Password) verification, with features that enhance security and user experience.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register with their email and login securely using a password.
- **Email Verification**: Upon registration, users receive a time-sensitive OTP via email to verify their account before gaining full access.
- **Password Reset**: Users can request a password reset OTP, sent to their registered email, to securely reset their password.
- **OTP Expiration**: OTPs are valid for a limited time to ensure security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses guide users through the authentication process with clear and actionable messages.
